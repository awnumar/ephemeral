# Instructions

First the dependencies must be installed and the project files built:

```bash
make build
```

This step does not have to be repeated unless `make clean` is called.

You can launch the service with:

```bash
make run
```

Build files can be cleaned up with:

```bash
make clean
```

### Webapp

To launch the frontend web-app independently of the server, see the `README.md` file within the webapp directory.
