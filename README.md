# Instructions

First the dependencies must be installed:

```bash
make install
```

Then you can launch an instance with:

```bash
make run
```

Build files can be cleaned up with:

```bash
make clean
```

For a fresh instance run:

```bash
make fresh
```

This will run `make clean` before installing and then running. 

### Webapp

To launch the frontend web-app independently of the server, see the `README.md` file within the webapp directory.
